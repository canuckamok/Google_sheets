# Google_sheets
Automation scripts in JavaScripts run in Google Sheets


#### To use these scripts:
1. open your spreadsheet in google sheets
2. Click on Tools -> Script Editor
3. Copy and paste my script into your script editor and save


I have made these scripts to run on my own sheets, so I can't guarantee that they will work for you. That being said, I have instructions for how I have formatted my spreadsheet for them to work written into each sheet.
I am happy to hear any constructive criticism about my code to make improvements
